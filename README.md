# Stream247 — YouTube 24/7 VOD Streamer

This repository contains a React + Electron rewrite of the original Stream247
project. The new interface is built with React and packaged with Electron,
providing a modern cross‑platform desktop experience.

## Development

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Launch the Electron app with `npm start`.

The React UI currently exposes a minimal form for the playlist URL and stream
key. Hooking the UI up to the actual streaming logic is still a work in
progress.
